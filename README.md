# Project-Apps
Python data analysis project 

The goal of this project is to find the most profitable within free to download and install apps. The number of users of our apps determines our revenue for any given app â€” the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better. All data comes from The Google Play Store: (https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) and The App Store: (https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps). This projekt is part of guided projekts from dataquest.io platform.

In this project I was training how to use dictionaries, lists, frequency tables and loops and how to enclose them within functions.
